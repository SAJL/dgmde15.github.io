Our first session will be spent investigating the question: Why do people code? We will spend out time • getting a sense of the people in the room and why *we* want to code • getting our machines set up with [the tools we’ll need](tools-and-materials) to work throughout the semester • taking our first stab at building something using HTML, CSS, and Javascript by designing our own digital business card to live on [the people page](people) of our course site with information about who we are.


### For next week

1. Set up up your local development environment by [the steps here](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/ec3e2f68b9ab8b2614a1) - this is the process we began in the first class session.
1. Make sure that you have *forked* the [class website repo](https://github.com/dgmde15/dgmde15.github.io) to your own Github account. More info on how to fork can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) with a video walkthrough [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jGUFpWYm60).
1. Once you have forked the class website repo, *clone* a copy to your computer so you can run a local version of the site and make changes to the site files. Instructions for this are part of [the steps here](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/ec3e2f68b9ab8b2614a1). You should be able to open Google Chrome, navigate to `http://localhost:4000` and see the course site pages (and any changes you may make to them).
1. After following the above steps, you are prepared to contribute to the site! During next week's session we'll walk through the process of adding yourself to the [`/people`](http://dgmde15.github.io/people/) page on the course website.
1. If you want to go ahead with the next steps: you'll be modifying the `people/index.html` file by adding a `div` element with an `id` specific to your name. Then, modify the `assets/css/people.css` file and add styling to your `id`. You can use the existing code as as a template.
1. Participate in the [Discourse forum](http://dgmde15.github.io/forum) conversation by posting projects that inspire you, or starting a new topic!
1. And finally, next week we're going to begin our discussions of storytelling and [the story project](https://github.com/dgmde15/Story-Project-1).  As part of that, we'd like you to both [check out the initial fversion of the site]() and please work through the various readings and videos in the [exploratory materials listed in the syllabus](/about#exploring-stories-storytelling).
